**Overview**

  Want to store your business documents on google docs but hate having
to jump into their online editor every time you want to view or edit
something?

  Do it from VIM with a little help from ruby!

**Why**
  
  Let's face it, you aren't going to have your business partners sign up
for github accounts to version your documents and share them with each
other -- that's what google documents is for. However, if you are like
me you NEED this utility to access your documents from the shell rather
than having to pop a browser window.

__Install__

  (install is a bit fucked right now -- we should fix it later)

  * rename creds.yml.example to creds.yml (and edit)

  * add the following to your .vimrc:
    :command Gsave :!vig %:p

  * sudo ln -s $HOME/vig/vig /usr/bin/vig

**Usage**

**What Currently Works**
  create_or_update will upload your currently working file to google
  docs upon a ':Gsave'

**TODO**
  * tests
