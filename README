I love to store documents for my business and other things on google
documents but I use vi... problems problems problems... so... I'm making
this!

INSTALL:
  (install is a bit fucked right now -- we should fix it later)

  * rename creds.yml.example to creds.yml (and edit)

  * add the following to your .vimrc:
    :command Gsave :!vig %:p

  * sudo ln -s $HOME/vig/vig /usr/bin/vig

What works currently:
  create_or_update will upload your currently working file to google
  docs upon a ':Gsave'

TODO:
  * tests
